<style>
/* Style the element with the id "myHeader" */
#myHeader {
  background-color: lightblue;
  color: black;
  padding: 30px;
  text-align: center;
}

/* Style all elements with the class name "GreekCity" */
.GreekCity {
  background-color: #9815B0;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px;
}
</style>


<!-- An element with a unique id -->
<h1 id="myHeader">Greek Cities</h1>

<!-- Multiple elements with same class -->
<h2 class="GreekCity">Athens</h2>

-------------

#idName for unique elements on the page. Good examples are #header and #footer
TAGNAME for general purpose page styling.
TAG.classname and .classname for exceptions/overrides to the above rules. (?? what is what again??)

-------------

You preference should be, in order from highest to lowest:
id
tag
tag.className
.className

ID selectors are fast. Tag selectors are reasonably fast. 
Pure class selectors are slow because the browser essentially has to interrogate every element and see if each has that class. 
Getting elements by ID or tag name are "native" operations from a browser's context.
