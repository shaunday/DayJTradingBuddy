All Trades will be fetched on app init (eventually to be paginated)- never stale, invalidate when????

Once data starts flowing in- 
start creating components

TradeComposite(tc): RQ for Summary (set initial with first data, only manual invalidate) keyd with tc id, map list of elements
TradeElement(te): RQ for self (initial with first data, only manual invalidate), map lists of cells
